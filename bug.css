The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results may occur due to unit mismatch or operator precedence issues.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely not produce the expected result because of the missing 'px' unit for 10. Another less obvious issue is the order of operations in complex calculations.  Parentheses are crucial to enforce the desired order.
